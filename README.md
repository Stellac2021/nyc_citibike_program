# NYC Citibike Analysis
With the movement towards a cleaner earther, bike sharing programs are an excellent way to acheive that goal. 

Please find the [full Tableau report here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sc8440/viz/nyc_citibike_challenge_16495360738400/CitibikeAnalysis)
## Purpose 
This anlaysis is a high level overview of a successful bike sharing program in New York City. We will look at riding patterns and user breakdowns. 

## Dense Locations

A successful program will need to establish a high number of starting/ending locations in order to fill the needs of the user.

## User Type Breakdown

From what have analyzed a large majority (81%) of users are subsribers, meaning long time revenue. 

![Customers](/resources/customer.png)

Also reinforcing the idea of dense number of locations, majority of riders will only have ride duration of 5 to 10 minutes. Meaning bike locations need to fall within that riding range. 

### User Commutes

Also of note is that subscribers will most likely being using these bikes for commutes.

![Customer_Commute](/resources/customer_heatmap.png)

As seen in the chart above, peak usage for subscribers is between 6AM to 8AM and 5PM to 8PM. 

## Gender Breakdown

Males (65%) make up a majority of ridership. Females represent 25% and about 10% did not reveal their gender.

It is also of note that ride duration between the 3 groups are consistent with each other and also user types. 

## Gender Commute

![Gender_Commute](/resources/gender_heatmap.png)

Both genders are similar peak hours surrounding general commute times. 

## Conclusion 

As dense city population can benefit from bike sharing program especially during peak commute times. This is turn will also help alieve traffic congestion. 

### Further Analysis 
While this analysis only looked at high level numbers, other possible areas of research would be: 

1. Create a map of where male/female rider start their ride.
2. Futher combine gender and customer type to discover which gender has more subscibers
